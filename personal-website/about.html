          From the moment I first stepped foot on a board, I felt an 
          exhilarating rush unlike anything else. With each heelflip and 
          ollie, I soared through the streets, my spirit was unbound by the
          constraints of gravity. Skateboarding is a source of freedom, expression and empowerment.
          I tell myself, if I can skateboard, then I can do anything I set my mind to!
        <br></br>
          I've found a sense of belonging within the skateboarding community. 
          Through each skatepark, I've found camaraderie and friendship 
          in fellow riders, bonding over shared triumphs and wipeouts alike. 
          Together, we pushed each other to new heights, constantly striving to 
          innovate and push the boundaries of what was possible on a board attached
          to four wheels.

            Newbie snowboarder here, started two years ago because my skateboarding
            friends insisted that I would be good. As I mentioned above, nothing is
            an obstacle because I skateboard. My friends were right, I am really good
            and I truly enjoy this sport. I want to dedicate this section to them because
            they're constantly pushing me to try new things. I'm not sure where I would
            be if it weren't for them.
           <br></br>
           Snowboarding wasn't as easy as I make it to be. There were many...many falls along
           the way which caused me to feel doubt and frustration. Yet, through perseverance
           and determination, I always found the strength to pick myself back up and try again.
           Winters are no longer boring and I have a refound love for it.

            My father was born in Cabo Rojo, Puerto Rico. The area he lived in was 
            also known as 'El Campo', which is another way to say that he lived in the
            country-side. His days consisted of farm work and mechanical/physical labor, 
            he loved to grow produce, tinker with machinery, or homes. My father taught
            me how to grow produce, flowers, and plants. Thank you daddy, you will continue
            to live in my heart!
